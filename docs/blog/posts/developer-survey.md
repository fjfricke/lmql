We have started a new initiative called the **LMQL developer survey**. With this short survey we have the goal of learning more from everyone around the LMQL and the bigger LLM community. We are looking for some broader feedback signals of how and what people are using LMQL for or would like to use it for. 

The outcome of this survey will help shape our work around the next major version of LMQL.

You can find the survey here: https://forms.gle/pGvAicNpUhS1rAkK9.
